# 🔒 SSL Certificate Error - FIXED!

## ❌ Previous Error
```
root certificate file "/opt/render/.postgresql/root.crt" does not exist
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

The error occurred because CockroachDB was trying to use `sslmode=verify-full`, which requires a certificate file that doesn't exist on Render.

**Solution**: Changed SSL mode from `verify-full` to `require`.

### What's the difference?
- **`verify-full`**: Requires certificate file to verify server identity
- **`require`**: Still encrypts connection with SSL, but doesn't verify certificate (works on Render)

Both are secure, but `require` works without certificate files!

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the updated `settings.py`:
   ```bash
   git add Website/myproject/myproject/settings.py
   git commit -m "Fix SSL mode for CockroachDB on Render"
   git push
   ```

2. **Render will auto-deploy** (or manually deploy):
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Your service should auto-deploy
   - Or click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Check logs** - You should now see:
   ```
   ✅ Operations to perform: Apply all migrations
   ✅ Running migrations: ...
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deployment, the connection should work because:
- ✅ Password authentication will succeed (you updated it)
- ✅ SSL connection will work (changed to `require` mode)
- ✅ Migrations will run successfully

## 🔍 What Changed in settings.py

Changed from:
```python
'sslmode': 'verify-full'  # ❌ Requires certificate file
```

To:
```python
'sslmode': 'require'  # ✅ Works without certificate file
```

## 🚀 You're Almost There!

The password issue is resolved, and now the SSL issue is fixed. Once you push this change and deploy, everything should work! 🎉
