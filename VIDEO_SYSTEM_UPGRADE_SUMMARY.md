## 🧪 Testing

### Test Each Platform:

   - Check mobile compatibility

2. **Add a test video from pCloud**
   - Verify HTML5 player loads
   - Test on mobile device ⭐
   - Verify controls work

3. **Add a test video from Google Drive**
   - Verify iframe embed works
   - Check playback quality

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

For **best mobile compatibility**, we recommend:

1. **Upload videos to pCloud**
2. **Get direct download link** (filedn.com format)
3. **Use pCloud option** when adding video
4. **Test on mobile first**

---

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Backward Compatible:** All existing MEGA videos still work
2. **Auto-Detection:** System can auto-detect platform from URL
3. **Validation:** Each platform has specific link validation
4. **No Data Loss:** Migration preserves all existing videos
5. **Default:** New videos default to MEGA if source not specified

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video Won't Play on Mobile (MEGA)
**Solution:** Re-upload to pCloud and update video source

### Invalid Link Error
**Solution:** Check link format matches platform requirements

### Video Source Not Saving
**Solution:** Make sure migration was applied: `python manage.py migrate myapp`

## ✨ Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the system with sample videos from each platform
2. ✅ Upload key videos to pCloud for mobile users
3. ✅ Update existing MEGA videos that need mobile support
4. ✅ Monitor user feedback on playback quality
